# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a systematic way of applying engineering principles and tools to develop and maintain a high quality software system.
it play a crucial role in the tech industry because it enables creation of software applications and systems that power various aspect of modern life. such as communication, commerce and Healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the establishment of software engineeringas a discipline in 1960s. 
the advent of structures of programing in the 1970s.
the rise of the Agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement, designs, development, testing, deployment and maintenance.
Requirements gathering and documentating user need and system requirements 
design: creating a high level and detailed design of softwares architecture and user interface.
implementation written of code and building the software accordingto the design specification.
testing is the verifying if the codes or command created are working as expected.
deployment is the  delivery of  the product to it user.
maintenance provide ongoing support and updates enhancements to the software after deployment  

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinc phase flowing Down like a water fall eg. while Agile methodologies is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
eg  Agile framework emphasizing small self-organizing teams working in short iterations called sprint.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a software developer responsible for writing codes and implementing software.
a Quality Assurance Engineer responsibility is to ensure software quality by designing and executing  test plan.
A Project Manager is responsible to oversees the planning,execution and delivery of the software project.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE is a software suit that provides comprehensive tools for  writing debugging and testing codes. eg visual studio and eclipse.
VCS this is a software tool for tracking change to source codes and coordinating works among team members 
eg Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changes of requirements during during development cycle,tight deadlines amd technical debt.
strategies to overcome these includes.
effective communication, Agile methodologies, prioritization of task and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
